In this project I simulated the rolling of three dice n times. Random variable "X" is the number of "successes" in n rolls. This is considered one experiment. I then repeated the experiment N times and created the probability distribution of the variable "X". As an alternative method to the simulation experiments, I used the formula for the Binomial distribution to calculate the probability distribution for the random variable "X". This method involves only calculations using the binomial formula, and does not involve simulations. Similarly, another alternative to the simulation experiments, is to use the formula for the Poisson distribution, which can approximate the Binomial under certain conditions.
